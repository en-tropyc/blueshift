### üè¶ Blueshift Anchor Vault (`blueshift_anchor_vault/`)

A Solana program built with Anchor framework that implements a simple SOL vault system where users can deposit and withdraw SOL to their personal Program Derived Address (PDA) vaults.

#### Features

- **User-specific vaults**: Each user gets their own vault derived from their public key
- **Deposit functionality**: Deposit SOL into your personal vault
- **Withdraw functionality**: Withdraw all SOL from your vault
- **Error handling**: Prevents double deposits and invalid amounts
- **Security**: Uses PDAs for secure, deterministic vault addresses

#### Quick Start

```bash
cd blueshift_anchor_vault

# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Build the program
anchor build

# Start local validator (in separate terminal)
solana-test-validator

# Deploy and test
anchor test --skip-local-validator
```

#### Program Instructions

- `deposit(amount: u64)` - Deposit SOL into your vault
- `withdraw()` - Withdraw all SOL from your vault

#### Architecture

- **Program ID**: Auto-generated during deployment
- **Vault PDA**: Derived from `["vault", user_pubkey]`
- **Accounts**: Uses System Program for SOL transfers
